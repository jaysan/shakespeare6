Romeo And Juliet
by Willaim Shakespeare

In fiar Verona, where we lay our scene...

SOME GUY: I bite my thumb at you.

JULIET: Ay, me.

ROMEO: BLAH BLAH BLAH.

ROMEO: Wherefore art thou?

TYBALT: A plague on both your houses.

JULIET: Oh I drank poison (or did I stab myself? I forget) and I'm dead now.

THE END
